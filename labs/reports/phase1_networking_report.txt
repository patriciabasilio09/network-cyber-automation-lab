Phase 1 - Networking Fundamentals Report

This phase focused on understanding how networking works at a foundational level.

Topics convered:
- IP addressing and private vs public IPs
- NAT and Host-only networking
- Subnetting and CIDR
- Routing tables and default fateways
- ARP and packet delivery
- Route selection logic and metrics
- IP planning and logical network design
- Basic network troubleshooting

What I learned:
I learned how a system decides where to send traffic, how networks are structured, and how routing, addressing, and ARP work together to make communication possible.

I can now:
- Identify and explain IP addresses and interfaces
- Explain how NAT and Host-only networking work
- Calculate subnet sizes and usable IP ranges
- Read and interpret routing tables 
- Predict packet flow for local and remote traffic
- Design a basic IP plan for small network 
- Use Linux tools to troubleshoot connectivity

How This Prepares Me:
This phase prepapres me for security work by giving me a strong understanding of how normal network traffic flows, which is required before detecting malicious behaviour.
