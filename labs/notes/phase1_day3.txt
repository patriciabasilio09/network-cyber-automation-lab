What is a subnet?
A subnet is a smaller network created from a larger network to organize and manage devices more efficiently.

Why do we need subnets?
Subnet group devicesso they can communicate with each other without going through the gaetway. They help organize networks, reduce unnecessary traffic, and improve performance and security.

Why can't .0 be used?
.0 is reserved as the network address, which represents the entire subnet.

Why can't .255 be used?
.255 is reserved as the broadcast address, which is used to send data to all devices in the subnet.

How does my computer decide:
-Local traffic?
Local traffic is sent directly to the destination device because it is in the same subnet.

- Remote traffic?
Remote traffic is sent to the default gateway so it can be routed to another network

What does ip route show?
ip route shows the routing table, including which networks are reachable and what the default gateway is.

What did "ip route get 8.8.8.8" tell me?
It shows which gateway and interface will be used to send traffic to 8.8.8.8

What would break if the gateway was missing?
Without the gateway, the system would not be able to communicate with any devices outside its subnet, including the internet.
