Topic: Alert Severity and Script Improvement

1. What is alert severity?
Severity shows how dangerous or urgent an alert is and helps analysts prioritize threats.

2. Why do we need multiple severity levels?
Because not all security events are equally dangerous. SOme need immediate action while others are informational.

3. How can thresholds represent severity?
Higher numbers of failed events usually indicate higher risk, so different count ranges map to different severity levels. 

4. What improvements did I add to my script today?
I added severity levels, timestamps, and cleaner formatted output that looks like real security alerts.

5. Why timestamps matter in security logs?
They allow analysts to track when activity happened, correlate events, and understand attack timestamps.
