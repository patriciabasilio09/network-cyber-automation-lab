Objective
Understand basic VM networking, including NAT and Host-only networking, and verify IP connectivity.

Concepts Learned
What is NAT? 
Network Address Translation allows devices with private IP address to access the internet by translating their traffic to use the host's public
IP address

What is Host-only networking?
It created a private network between the host machine and the virtual machine that does not have direct internet access.

Why do we need both?
We use both the NAT and Host-only networking so the virtual machine can access the internet while also allowing direct communication with the host
system for lab testing and troubleshooting.
