Topic: Log Analysis & Mini SIEM Automation

What is log analysis?
Log analysis is examning system logs to detect suspicious activity, failures, or security threats.

What is auth.log?
auth.log records authentication activity such as SSH logins, sudo usage, and failed login attempts.

What problem are we solving?
We want to identify which IP addresses are attempting failed SSH logins the most.

Why not push auth.log to Github?
Because it contains sensitive system data. Only scripts and nores are shared, never real logs.

What does our script do?
It:
- Searches for SSH failed login attempts
- Extracts IP addresses only
- Counts how many times each IP appears
- Shows the top attackers

Why use pattern matching instead of field numbers?
Because logs are messy and field positions change. Pattern matching is reliable and professional. 

What does this simulate?
This simulates how a SIEM detects brute-force attacks and repeated authentication failures.
