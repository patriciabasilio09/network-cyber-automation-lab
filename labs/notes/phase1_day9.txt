Topic: Route Selection Logic

1. Result of: "ip route get 8.8.8.8". Why did 8.8.8.8 use the default route?
Traffic to 8.8.8.8 uses the default route because it is not part of any local network. The defaukt route is used when no more specific route exists.

2. Results of: "ip route get <host-only ip>". Why did the host-only IP use the host-only interface?
Traffic to the host-only IP uses the local interface because it is in the same subnet. Local traffic always uses the directly connected interface. 

3. What is route metric?
A route metric is a cost value assigned to a route.

4. When is metric used?
Metric is used only when two routes have the same destination network and the same prefix length. The route with the lowest metric is chosen.

Summary:
Linux selects routes by choosing the most specific match first, and if there is a tie, it selects the route with the lowest metric.
