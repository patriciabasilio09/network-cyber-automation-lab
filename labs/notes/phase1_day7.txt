Topic: ARP and Packet Flow Basics

What is ARP?
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to find the MAC address that belongs to an IP address on the local network.

What is a MAC address?
A MAC address is a unique hardware address assigned to a network interface. It is used to deliver data at the Ethernet level.

Difference between IP and MAC:
IP address = logical address used for routing and identification on a network.
MAC address = physical address used for local network delivery.

What happens when I ping a device on my subnet?
My computer sends an ARP broadcast asking for the MAC address of the target IP. Once the MAC is known, packets are sent directly to that device.

What happens when I ping a device outside my subnet?
My computer sends traffic to the default gateway. It first uses ARP to find the MAC address of the gateway, then sends the packet to the router.

What does "ip neigh" show?
It shows the ARP table, which maps IP addersses to MAC addresses that my system has learned. 

Why is ARP a broadcast?
Because the sender does not yet know the MAC address, it must ask all devices on the subnet.

Why does subnet size matter?
Larger subnets create more broadcast traffic, which slows down the network and increases unnecessary processing.

Security note: Why ARP can be abused:
ARP has no authentication, so attackers can send fake ARP replies to redirect traffic also known as ARP spoofing.
