Topic: Exploring and Reading Linux Logs

1. Where are Linux logs stored?
Most Linux logs are stored in the /var/log/ directory. This folder contains system, authentication, kernel, and application logs.

2. What is syslog?
syslog is the main system log file. It records general system activity such as service starts, error, network events, and background processes.
3. What is auth.log?
auth.log records authentication-related events. This includes user logins, failed login attempts, sudo usage, and session creation and termination. This is one of the most important files for security monitoring.
4. What does grep do?
grep searches for specific words or patterns inside files. It is used quickly to find important events like failed logins, errors, and suspicious activity.
5. What does tail do?
tail shows the last lines of a file. It is used to see most recent events.
6. What does tail if do?
tail -f shows new log entries in real time as they happen.
7. Why is auth.log important in cybersecurity? 
Because it shows who tried to log in, who failed, who used admin privileges, and possilbe brute-force attacks.
8. What did Iobserve today?
I learned how to navigate to /var/log, read logs using less, search logs using grep, monitor logs live using tail -f, and understand the structure of log entries.
