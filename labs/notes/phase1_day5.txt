Topic: Subnet CAlculations (Network, Broadcast, Usable IPs)
Date: 01/12/2026

Objective:
Learn how to calculate subnets manually by finding block size, network address, broadcast address, and usable IP ranges.


Method:
1. FInd the subnet mask from CIDR
2. Calcualte block size: 256 - last octect of the subnet mask
3. For each subnet:
    - Network = starting address
    - Broadcast = next subnet start -1
    - Usable = between network and broadcast

EXample: /26 subnet

Network: 192.168.10.0/26
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
Block size: 256 - 192 = 64

Subnet		Network Address		Broadcast Address	Usable Range
1		192.168.10.0		192.168.10.63		.1-.62
2		192.168.10.64		192.168.10.127		.65-.126
3		192.168.10.128		192.168.10.191		.129-.190
4		192.168.10.192		192.168.10.255		.193-.254

Verification

Command used:
ipcalc 192.168.10.10/26

Summary:
Today I learned how to manually calculate subnets by finding the block size and using it to determine network address, broadcast addresses, and usable IP ranges. I can now split networks using CIDR and design subnets based on real host requirements.
