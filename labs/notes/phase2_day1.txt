Topic: Logging, Monitoring, and SIEM fundamentals

1. What is a log? 
A log is a record of events that happen on a system. It shows actions like logins, errors, service starts, network connections, and security-related activity. Logs act like a system's memory. 

2. Why are logs important?
Logs are important because they allow us to detect security events, investigate attacks, troubleshoot problems, and prove what happened on a system. Without logs, security teams have no visibility.

3. Where do logs come from?
Logs are generated by operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, authentication systems, and security tools.

4. What is monitoring?
Monitoring is the continuous observation of systems and logs to detect abnormal or suspicious activity. It helps identify problems or attacks as they happen.

5. What is a SIEM?
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management it collects logs from many systems, stores them in one place, allows searching and analysis, detects suspicious patterns, and generates alets for security teams. 

6. Why do we centralize logs?
Centralizing logs means sending logs from many systems to one server. This is important because logs are easier to search, attacks are easier to detect, investigations are faster, and it mirros real professional security environments.

7. What is the log flow?
[Systems] -> [Logs generated] -> [Log Server / SIEM] -> [Analysis & Alerts]
