Topic: Events, Alerts, Baselines, False Positives, Severity

1. What is an event?
An event is anything that happens on a system and gets logged.

2. What is an Alert?
An alert is when an event is considered suspicious or dangerous.

3. Difference between Event and Alert:
Events are raw logs. Alerts are warnings generated when events look suspicious.

4. What is a Baseline?
A baseline is the normal pattern of behavior for a system or network.

5. Why are baselines important?
Baselines help identify abnormal behavior by comparing current activity to what is normally expected.

6. What is a False Positives?
A false positive is when a security alert is triggered by legitimate activity.

7. What is Severity?
Severity is a level used to prioritize alerts based on how dangerous they are.

8. Examples:
Low Severity: 2 failed SSH attempts 
Medium Severity: 50+ failed SSH attempts in a minute
High Severity: SSH brute force followed by successful login

9. How this applies to my SSH log analyzer:
My script converts raw SSH failure events into alerts by applying a theshold, which represents a basic baseline and severity rule.
