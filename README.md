## Overview

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through networking, cybersecurity, Linux, and automation.

The goal of this lab is to build real, job-relevant skills for entry-level IT, networking, and security roles by:

- Working in a Linux-based virtual environment

- Building and documenting a home lab

- Automating tasks instead of relying only on tools

- Writing clear technical notes and reports

Everything here is done step-by-step to mirror how professionals learn and work in real environments.

## Lab Environment

Host OS: Personal computer

Virtualization: VirtualBox

Guest OS: Ubuntu Linux

Networking Modes:

- NAT (internet access)

- Host-only (host ↔ VM communication)

## Repository Structure

├── notes/      # Daily learning notes and concept explanations

├── scripts/    # Bash and Python automation scripts


## What I Am Learning

- Linux fundamentals and command-line usage
- Virtual machines and virtualization concepts
- Networking basics (IP addressing, NAT, host-only networking)
- Bash scripting and task automation
- Git and GitHub for version control and documentation
- Cybersecurity fundamentals (later phases)
- Networking troubleshooting using Linux tools (ip, nmcli, ping)

## Current Progress

### Phase 0: Environment setup and foundations
✔ Ubuntu VM setup  
✔ Networking configuration  
✔ First automation script  
✔ GitHub repository initialized
  
### Phase 1: Networking Fundamentals
✔ Day 1 – IP addressing basics  
✔ Day 2 – Network interfaces and connectivity  
✔ Day 3 – Routing and gateways  
✔ Day 4 – Subnetting, CIDR, and usable IPs  
✔ Day 5 – Subnet calculations (network, broadcast, usable ranges)

## Next Steps

Expand networking labs

Add automation for IP discovery and monitoring

Introduce security monitoring and logging

Build toward a final capstone project
